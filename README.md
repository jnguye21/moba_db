# MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) Database

## Project Summary:

We are designing a database for a generalized MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) where the user should be able to query info about the game as well as player profile information. This database will also store information about the current game that a player is currently in. MOBAs can be complex games having different entities including champions, abilities, items, map values, game values, and player account information. Typically, this genre of video games has two teams of players face off on a single map, with each team trying to destroy the enemy teamâ€™s base.  The database will include personal information that each player used to sign up for an account, and from there will relate the player to the characters that it can choose in the game. Many other aspects of the game, including purchasable items, character statistics, and details about the map and its contents will be stored under appropriately named and respective entities.
